title: Python 3.7 Support in MPF 0.52
tags: [software, MPF, python]
---
We recently added [Python 3.7 Support](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/pull/1300) to MPF.

With the next release we will deprecate Python 3.4 because it keeps us from
using some of the newer asyncio APIs.
Additionally, with Python 3.8 we have to remove 3.4 support since those the old
APIs will be removed.
Good thing is that MPF only got faster with every release and there is no good
reason to use Python 3.4 anymore.
Ubuntu 14.04 was the last major Linux distribution which shipped it and it is
going out of long-time support in April (that is also only for the server
version and not the desktop/embedded version).
That said, the next Debain release will ship 3.7 and you can also download it
on Windows or Mac.
However, don't do that just know unless you want to use the dev version of MPF.
Python 3.7 support will be available in the next MPF 0.52 release.

Did we forget anything? Please let us know!
