title: Segment Displays on Light Drivers
tags: [hardware, MPF]
---
We recently added support for segment displays connected to light on any
platform in MPF.
For now, we support only seven segment display but we can add any type if there
is demand.
Adding support mostly comes down to creating the right mapping table.
Let us know if you need any other type of displays.

There seems to be a large number of different displays on the market so we
expect to support all kinds of displays in the future.
This includes types such as RGB segment displays and different connection
types such as I2C or SPI.
Please join the discussion in our forum if you need any of those!

Did we forget anything? Please let us know!
