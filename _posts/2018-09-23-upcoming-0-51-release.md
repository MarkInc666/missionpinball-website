What will change in the upcoming 0.51 maintainance release?

We are currently preparing for the 0.51 release which will not require
migrations for most users (unless you are using accelerometers).
You might have to run minor cleanups if you are using non-functional/noop
options (such as width on images) which have been removed.
Besides that 0.51 should bring major performance improvements around switches
and event handling.
Furthermore, we improve the error/logging output and added a new production
flag which optimizes the behaviour for unattended operations.


Did we forget anything? Please let us know.
